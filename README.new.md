# GitHub-Tools

⚠️ Install scripts definitely broken right now.

⚠️ To find a script, just peep inside [`/shell/`](/shell/) and wing it.

⚠️ They're sorted intuitively.

A collection of scripts and userscripts for automating GitHub maintenance and repository management.

Each tool exists to make repetitive Git tasks a little less tedious.
